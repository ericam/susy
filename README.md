Power Tools For The Web
=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ericam/susy.png?branch=susy-next)](https://travis-ci.org/ericam/susy)

Susy is an agnostic set of tools
for creating powerful, custom layouts.
We provide the language,
but you provide all the opinions.
Use a grid, don't use a grid,
or use a combination of grids â€”
it's all up to you.

We didn't want to build another opinionated grid system,
we wanted to build power tools
that you could use anywhere you want.

Your markup, your layout | *our math*
